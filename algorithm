/******FOR Malloc Function*****************/

#Implemting Double linked list
  #If block is found with required size return address
  #If block is larger split and return the address add newblock to the list
  #If Unable to find block of required size request OS using sbrk()
  
#After calling sbrk()
  #Create a new block with allocated size
    #First 24 Bytes are Metadata for Next and Previous block (Data about data present in block)
  #Split new block and return the exaact size block to user
    #Example - > #define BLOCK_MEM(ptr) ((void *)((unsigned long)ptr + sizeof(block_t)))
   
#Thigs to be known 
  #Required starting adress for the heap
  #Maximum required block by the user
  #my realloc function
  #Adddress rage of shared heap
